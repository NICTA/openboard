It supports a sustainable legal assistance sector by ensuring that services are directed where they are needed most. The Agreement also encourages legal assistance providers to build a collaborative, sector-wide approach to service delivery, through formalised service planning processes.</p><p Service planning allows jurisdictions to identify gaps and overlaps in legal assistance services, to assist with improving front-line service delivery. The outcomes of this process inform state and territory decision‑making about the allocation of Commonwealth and state and territory funding for CLCs in each jurisdiction. Service planning is an essential reform in this Agreement and provides the sector with opportunities to work as one to achieve the Agreement’s objective and outcomes. In 2015-16, all states and territories met the service planning milestones under the Agreement.</p><p>The national benchmarks ensure available Commonwealth funding is prioritised for legal assistance services to financially disadvantage people.

It supports a sustainable legal assistance sector by ensuring that services are directed where they are needed most. The Agreement also encourages legal assistance providers to build a collaborative, sector-wide approach to service delivery, through formalised service planning processes.</p><p Service planning allows jurisdictions to identify gaps and overlaps in legal assistance services, to assist with improving front-line service delivery. The outcomes of this process inform state and territory decision‑making about the allocation of Commonwealth and state and territory funding for CLCs in each jurisdiction. Service planning is an essential reform in this Agreement and provides the sector with opportunities to work as one to achieve the Agreement’s objective and outcomes. In 2015-16, all states and territories met the service planning milestones under the Agreement.</p><p>The national benchmarks ensure available Commonwealth funding is prioritised for legal assistance services to financially disadvantage people.

The Agreement includes funding for legal aid commissions (LACs) and community legal centres (CLCs). It supports a sustainable legal assistance sector by ensuring that services are directed where they are needed most. The Agreement also encourages legal assistance providers to build a collaborative, sector-wide approach to service delivery, through formalised service planning processes.</p><p Service planning allows jurisdictions to identify gaps and overlaps in legal assistance services, to assist with improving front-line service delivery. The outcomes of this process inform state and territory decision‑making about the allocation of Commonwealth and state and territory funding for CLCs in each jurisdiction. Service planning is an essential reform in this Agreement and provides the sector with opportunities to work as one to achieve the Agreement’s objective and outcomes. In 2015-16, all states and territories met the service planning milestones under the Agreement.</p><p>The national benchmarks ensure available Commonwealth funding is prioritised for legal assistance services to financially disadvantage people. Financially disadvantaged people are also more likely to have legal problems and fall into other categories of priority clients.</p>",

It supports a sustainable legal assistance sector by ensuring that services are directed where they are needed most. The Agreement also encourages legal assistance providers to build a collaborative, sector-wide approach to service delivery, through formalised service planning processes.</p><p Service planning allows jurisdictions to identify gaps and overlaps in legal assistance services, to assist with improving front-line service delivery. The outcomes of this process inform state and territory decision‑making about the allocation of Commonwealth and state and territory funding for CLCs in each jurisdiction. Service planning is an essential reform in this Agreement and provides the sector with opportunities to work as one to achieve the Agreement’s objective and outcomes.

The Agreement also encourages legal assistance providers to build a collaborative, sector-wide approach to service delivery, through formalised service planning processes.</p><p Service planning allows jurisdictions to identify gaps and overlaps in legal assistance services, to assist with improving front-line service delivery. The outcomes of this process inform state and territory decision‑making about the allocation of Commonwealth and state and territory funding for CLCs in each jurisdiction. Service planning is an essential reform in this Agreement and provides the sector with opportunities to work as one to achieve the Agreement’s objective and outcomes. In 2015-16, all states and territories met the service planning milestones under the Agreement.</p><p>The national benchmarks ensure available Commonwealth funding is prioritised for legal assistance services to financially disadvantage people.
